Users can register, edit his or her information, search for others name by fuzzy search and next they send request to people they find. For the administrators, they can delete the account.

Users can get coins when they focus for a period of time, and the calculated coins can be paid for trees(provided in the store of stystem). Once they buy the tree, their coins will decrease and the treeId will be pushed into user schema, too.

Trees have two type, bush and tree, represented by 0 and 1 in database.

Once users focus doing things, the start time and end time will be recorded into the database, with what type of trees they plant(treeId), what they do(tagId). All of these data generates a record.

Tags are used to mark how emergency the activity is, and what the user do during the focus time.

More functions will be added in the near future.
